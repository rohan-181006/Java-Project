# Problem Statement

Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) allow users to perform essential banking operations without visiting a bank in person. 
However, implementing the basic logic behind ATM behavior is an important step in learning programming concepts such as user interaction, modular design, and data processing.

This project aims to build a simple console-based ATM simulation using Java. The system should allow a user to:

1. View their current account balance  
2. Deposit an amount into their account  
3. Withdraw a valid amount from their account  
4. Exit the system  

The system must operate in a loop-like flow where the user can perform multiple operations until they choose to exit. 
It should validate input values, prevent invalid transactions, and simulate real ATM processing delays.

This project demonstrates the practical understanding of:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation
- Modular program structure
- User input handling
- Basic validation
- Simple simulation of real-life systems

The goal is to create a functional, clean, and easy-to-use ATM simulation that models the core operations of an actual ATM machine.
