# ATM Machine Simulation (Java)

## Overview
This is a simple console-based ATM simulation program built using Java.  
The user can perform the following operations:

- View account balance  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Exit the system  

The project follows object-oriented programming principles and includes additional modules for input validation and delay simulation.
