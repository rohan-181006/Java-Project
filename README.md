# ATM Machine Simulation (Java)

## Overview
This is a simple console-based ATM simulation program built using Java.  
The user can perform the following operations:

- View account balance  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Exit the system  

The project follows object-oriented programming principles and includes additional modules for input validation and delay simulation.

## Features
- Modular design (5 classes)
- Encapsulation in ATM operations
- Input validation for safe transactions
- Simulated ATM processing delay using a utility class
- Menu-driven user interface
